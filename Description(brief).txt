PhysioSmart: Medicine Detection using Raspberry Pi

This project is designed to help detect medicines 
using a Raspberry Pi and its camera module. It captures
 an image of a medicine, performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
 to read the medicine's name, and provides feedback based on a list
 of medicines stored in a text file. The feedback includes whether 
the medicine is prescribed, when to take it, and a description. 
The Raspberry Pi uses text-to-speech (TTS) to speak this information out loud.

### What You Need
- A Raspberry Pi (I used Raspberry Pi 3, but newer models will work as well)
- A PiCamera module
- A MicroSD card with Raspberry Pi OS installed
- A speaker or headphones (for the audio output)

### Software Setup
1. First, I installed the required software on the Raspberry Pi:
   
   Open the terminal and run the following commands:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   sudo apt install mpg321
   pip3 install picamera requests pillow gtts
   ```

2. Next, I had to enable the PiCamera. This can be done by typing:
   ```
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
   Go to "Interfacing Options" and select "Camera." Enable it, and
 then reboot the Raspberry Pi.

3. I used OCR.Space to handle the text extraction. You'll need to 
sign up at their website and get an API key. Once you have the API 
key, open the Python script and replace the placeholder where it 
says `api_key` with your actual API key.

### How to Set Up the Medicine List
The medicine details are stored in a text file named `medicines.txt`
. In this file, I added the medicines in the following format:
```
MedicineName|Description|Time
```
For example:
```
Paracetamol|For fever and pain relief|09:00 AM
Aspirin|Blood thinner and anti-inflammatory|02:00 PM
```
Each medicine's name, description, and time to take it should be
 separated by the `|` symbol.

### Running the Code
Once everything is set up, run the script by typing:
```
python3 your_script_name.py
```

The camera will capture an image of the medicine label. The script
 will then extract text from the image and check it against the medicines
 in the `medicines.txt` file. If it finds a match, it will speak the 
details (medicine name, description, and time to take it) using text-to-speech.
 If the medicine isn't found, it will say "Not prescribed."

### Troubleshooting
- If no text is extracted, make sure the label is clear, well-lit,
 and properly positioned in front of the camera.
- If there's no audio, check your speaker/headphone connection and make 
sure `mpg321` is installed for playing the TTS output.

### How to Add or Edit Medicines
To update the medicines list, simply open the `medicines.txt` file 
and add or modify the lines with new medicine information in the
 same format as described above. No need to retrain or modify the
 script itselfâ€”just update the text file.

This should help you get the project up and running. If you need to
 add more functionality, you can tweak the Python code as needed or experiment with new features.
